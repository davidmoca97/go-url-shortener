### How to run it?

1. Clone the repo
1. Download Docker and Docker compose
2. Open the terminal and go to the repo folder
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Open `localhost:9999` in your browser

> Docker compose runs a development version of the project,so no binary is build. Feel free to create your own DockerFile to run it in a build way

You can also run the app without Docker with your local instances of Go and MongoDB. Just make sure to have the correspond variables for the database.
